# See ArduPilot!

ArduPilot is the most advanced, full-featured, and reliable open source autopilot software available.
It has been under development since 2010 by a diverse team of professional engineers, computer scientists, and community contributors.
Our autopilot software is capable of controlling almost any vehicle system imaginable, from conventional airplanes, quad planes, multi-rotors, and helicopters to rovers, boats, balance bots, and even submarines.
It is continually being expanded to provide support for new emerging vehicle types.
